Welcome to my CIS 152 - Data Structures final project! The purpose of this application is for colleges who have prospective college students
to be able to filter out applicants based on their GPA in high school. Often times applications are flooded by lots of information about the student, their 
GPA, scores, and other information. With a lot of information to go through, it woule be convenient for College's to be able to filter out people who do not
meet their requirements by quickly entering the GPA of the applicants and taking out applications based on if their GPA meets the college's minimum requirements.
The user starts by entering all of the GPAs of the applicants, and when they have finished entering the GPAs, the user enters -1 to move on to the next step. The
program then sorts the GPAs in ascending order from the lowest GPA entered to the highest. After this process has completed, the user will enter the minimum GPA that
the college requires to enter. After the user enters the target GPA, a search algorithm will filter out each GPA that is smaller than the target GPA entered. After all
this has completed, the program finally outputs how many GPAs have been filtered from the list of potential prospects and outputs the new list of GPAs that have passed 
inspection. Now we have a new filtered list of applicants just by taking their GPAs!
